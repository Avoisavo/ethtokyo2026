# Petri

Petri's a version tree for AI agent harnesses. A harness is the code around a model:
the prompt, the retry loop, the context it reads. Petri records every change to it.

Each version in the tree holds three things:

1. A hypothesis in plain English, with the result that would prove it wrong.
2. A benchmark score, measured as the median of 5 runs.
3. Signatures from other keys that re-ran the measurement.

A version is accepted only when 2 other keys re-run it and agree. Rejected versions are
never deleted, so the next agent reads them and does not try the same idea again.

## The problem

1. **Nobody measures.** Teams change a prompt, then say the agent "feels better". There is
   no baseline and no repeat count.
2. **Failures stay private.** A dead end stays in one person's terminal. The next engineer
   tries the same idea again and pays for the same tokens.
3. **Nobody can check a claim.** A reported gain cannot be re-run, because the harness and
   the measurement are not published.

## How Petri answers it

| Problem | What Petri does |
|---|---|
| Nobody measures | Every version runs 20 coding tasks 5 times. The median counts. |
| Failures stay private | Rejected versions stay in the tree with their reason. `petri digest` gives them to the next agent. |
| Nobody can check a claim | A version id is the SHA-256 of its manifest. Other keys re-run both the parent and the version, then sign the result. |

The evolution model:

- **Variation:** a version changes at most 2 files and 120 lines of its parent.
- **Inheritance:** a version starts from its parent's harness files.
- **Selection:** the acceptance rule in `petri/src/policy/acceptance.ts` sets the status.

---

## The acceptance rule

1. A verifier re-runs the parent and the version. Each side runs 5 times.
2. The author's key cannot verify its own version. Two reports from one key count as one.
3. The version is **accepted** when 2 distinct keys each measure at least +1000 basis points.
   (100 basis points = 1%.)
4. At or below -1000 basis points, it is **rejected** as a regression.
5. Between those limits, it is **rejected** as within noise.
6. A version that a guard or the typecheck stopped is never scored. It stays **pending**.

---

## Run it

You need Node and pnpm. No API key is needed.

### The web app

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

1. Open http://localhost:3000.
2. Pick a domain, a model and a harness. The default is Research · Claude Sonnet 5 · Hermes Agent.
3. Open **Coding · Claude Sonnet 5 · Petri harness v1** to see the real tree.
4. Use the **Tree | Stats** switch to change the view.

The Petri harness tree comes from the engine in `petri/`. The page runs `petri export`
and `petri digest` on every request. The other trees are showcase trees. They show how
other domains could look. Nobody measured them.

### The engine

```bash
cd petri
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck       # no output means it passed
pnpm test            # 100 tests
pnpm petri tree      # the whole tree, rejected branches included
pnpm petri digest    # what the next agent reads before it proposes a change
pnpm petri dead-ends # every rejected version with its reason
```

---

## The recorded tree

`petri/.petri/` holds 16 versions: 3 accepted, 2 rejected and 11 pending. Each version
and each verification is one signed line in `petri/.petri/log.jsonl`, and the statuses
are computed from those lines. Each line carries a hash of the line before it, so Petri
refuses a log with an edited line or a gap.

| Version | Status | What it tried |
|---|---|---|
| `0a54718a` | pending (the start) | Single-shot prompt, no retry. 5 of 20 tasks. |
| `ecc7cdb0` | accepted, +7000bp | Full symbol signatures and one worked example. 19 of 20 tasks. |
| `872aaa3d` | rejected, -7000bp | Removing the signatures and the example again |
| `ea3b7532` | accepted, +7000bp | Restoring them, one step after the rejected version |
| `f07e0c55` | rejected, -7000bp | Trimming the prompt again to save tokens |
| `92dc9c49` | accepted, +7000bp | Restoring the signatures after the trim |
| `ec1d39e6` | pending, 1 of 2 keys | An independent re-test of signatures and example, +7000bp so far |
| `e1adae18` | pending, 1 of 2 keys | A short prompt without the reply-shape block, -7000bp so far |
| `2e7f6b5b` | pending, not scored | Stating every prompt rule as a positive directive |
| 7 more | pending, not scored | Changes stopped by a guard or by the typecheck |

All scores are from **replay mode**. Replay runs recorded model answers through the real
sandbox, and the tests really run. It does not call a model.

---

## Demo: a second key accepts a version

`ec1d39e6` has 1 verification. One more verification from a different key accepts it.

1. Open http://localhost:3000/tree/coding--petri-harness-v1--claude-sonnet-5.
2. Find "An independent re-test confirms…". It shows `1 of 2 keys`.
3. Run the second verification:

   ```bash
   cd petri
   PETRI_HOME=~/petri-demo-keys/k3 pnpm petri verify ec1d39e6
   ```

4. Refresh the page. The version is now accepted and shows purple.

`~/petri-demo-keys/` exists on the machine that built this tree only. On another machine,
create a new key first. Any key that is not the author's key works:

```bash
PETRI_HOME=~/my-verifier pnpm petri id create --label verifier
PETRI_HOME=~/my-verifier pnpm petri verify ec1d39e6
```

To reset the tree after a demo:

```bash
git checkout -- petri/.petri
git clean -fd petri/.petri
```

## ENS: every version's record on its name

Each version has an ENS name under `petri.eth`. The name reads from the version up to the root:

| Version | Name |
|---|---|
| `0a54718a` (the root) | `petriharnessv1.petri.eth` |
| `ecc7cdb0` | `addsigs.petriharnessv1.petri.eth` |
| `872aaa3d` | `dropsigs.addsigs.petriharnessv1.petri.eth` |

The name's resolver holds the version's record as text records. The node panel on the tree page
reads them, and any ENS client can read the same record.

| Key | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `description` | The hypothesis |
| `petri.id`, `petri.parent` | The version id (SHA-256 of its manifest) and its parent's id |
| `petri.status`, `petri.verdict`, `petri.reason` | The status, the engine's code (for example `WIN`) and the reason |
| `petri.score`, `petri.score-source`, `petri.bench` | The score in basis points, where it comes from (`author`, `rerun` or `predicted`), and the number of tasks |
| `petri.delta`, `petri.keys`, `petri.min-keys`, `petri.checks` | The checked change, the counted keys, the keys needed, and each check by another key as JSON |
| `petri.tokens` | Median tokens per task |
| `petri.falsified-if`, `petri.area`, `petri.motif`, `petri.metric`, `petri.mode`, `petri.blocked` | How it could be proven wrong, and its tags |

ENSv2 runs on Sepolia. One resolver on `petri.eth` serves every version name. It stores records per
full name and answers wildcard lookups, so no subname registry is needed.

1. Set up `petri.eth` once in the ENS playground at http://localhost:3000/ens. Mint test USDC and
   deploy your resolver (section 1), register `petri.eth` (section 2), then point it at your
   resolver (section 3).
2. See what would be written. This needs no key:

   ```bash
   npm run ens:publish -- --dry-run
   ```

3. Put the same account's key in `.env.local` as `PETRI_ENS_PRIVATE_KEY`, then write:

   ```bash
   npm run ens:publish
   ```

The script writes only the records that differ from ENS, 60 per transaction, then reads them back.
Run it again after new checks to update the verdicts. Section 8 of `/ens` does the same from a
browser wallet. Until `petri.eth` has a resolver, every lookup comes back empty and the panel
shows the local log.

## World ID after each verification

After `petri verify` signs a report, it can check the verifier with World ID. The check
is **off** by default.

```bash
PETRI_WORLD_ID=1 PETRI_WORLD_ADDRESS=0xYourAgentWallet \
  PETRI_HOME=~/my-verifier pnpm petri verify <node>
```

1. The check looks up the wallet in World AgentBook on World Chain.
2. It records the anonymous human id, or the reason there is none, in
   `.petri/world-checks.jsonl`.

The lookup has run against World Chain. Two limits stay:

- The check does not yet prove that the wallet belongs to the key that signed the report.
- It does not change the acceptance rule. A report without a human id still counts.

---

## Add a new version

```bash
cd petri
MODE=replay ./demo/positive-prompt.sh
```

The script proposes a change under `ecc7cdb0` and submits it. In replay mode the change
passes the guards and the typecheck. It is recorded as `not-scored`, because replay holds
recorded answers for 2 harness versions only.

A live run can score a new harness. It needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... ./demo/positive-prompt.sh
```

The live path has not been run on this tree yet.

---

## What the sandbox enforces

- The harness runs in a child process under Node `--permission`. It can read the prompt
  and the harness files only. It cannot read the tests.
- The generated solution runs in a second child process. The test source is never written to disk.
- A patch that changes more than 2 files or 120 lines, or changes `harness/contract.ts`, is refused.
- `petri verify` refuses a version that was never scored.

## What this does not prove

- **A verifier can sign without running the benchmark.** Nothing compares result hashes
  across verifiers yet.
- **Distinct keys are not distinct people.** One person can create many keys. The World ID
  check is off by default, and it does not yet link a wallet to a signing key.
- **The log is one file on one machine.** Its hash chain catches an edited line or a gap.
  Nothing outside this machine records when each line was written, and the log does not
  show that the benchmark really ran.
- **Replay covers 2 harness versions.** A new harness needs a live run to get a score.
- **The benchmark is 20 tasks.** A gain here may not carry over to other work.
- **Live mode is not deterministic.** The median of 5 runs reduces noise. It does not remove it.
